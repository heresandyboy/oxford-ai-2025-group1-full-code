## Individual Agent Specifications

## 🎯 Andy - Orchestrator Agent Implementation

### **Agent Purpose**

Central coordinator that uses other agents as tools to provide comprehensive logistics analysis.

### **Key Responsibilities**

1. Analyze logistics scenarios and determine which specialist agents to engage
2. Coordinate data flow between agents
3. Synthesize results into cohesive recommendations
4. Make decisions about when to use parallel vs sequential agent execution

### **Implementation Requirements**

#### **1. Agent Configuration**

```python
class LogisticsOrchestrator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.agent = Agent[LogisticsContext](
            name="LogisticsOrchestrator",
            instructions=self._get_instructions(),
            model="gpt-4o-mini",
            tools=self._get_all_agent_tools(),
            output_type=ComprehensiveLogisticsAnalysis,
            model_settings=ModelSettings(
                reasoning={"summary": "auto"},
                tool_choice="auto"  # Let agent decide when to use tools
            )
        )
```

#### **2. Tool Integration**

Andy must implement wrapper functions for each specialist agent:

```python
@function_tool
async def analyze_routes(
    wrapper: RunContextWrapper[LogisticsContext]
) -> RouteAnalysisResult:
    """Analyze and optimize delivery routes."""
    route_agent = RouteOptimizationAgent()
    result = await Runner.run(
        route_agent.agent,
        input="Analyze routes for optimization opportunities",
        context=wrapper.context
    )
    return result.final_output

@function_tool  
async def analyze_delays(
    wrapper: RunContextWrapper[LogisticsContext]
) -> DelayAnalysisResult:
    """Identify delays and bottlenecks."""
    delay_agent = DelayAnalysisAgent()
    result = await Runner.run(
        delay_agent.agent,
        input="Analyze shipment delays and identify bottlenecks", 
        context=wrapper.context
    )
    return result.final_output

# Similar wrapper functions for risk assessment and data collection
```

#### **3. Orchestration Logic**
