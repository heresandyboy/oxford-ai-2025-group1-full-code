# Getting Started Plan

Based on your documents and the logistics use case, here's a comprehensive plan to get you started with the OpenAI Agents SDK for shipment and delivery tracking optimization:

## üìã Project Plan: Logistics - Shipment and Delivery Tracking

### **Phase 1: Project Setup & Foundation (Day 1)**

#### 1.1 Environment Setup

- Open Google Colab and create a new notebook
- Install OpenAI Agents SDK: `!pip install openai-agents`
- Set up your OpenAI API key securely using Colab's secrets
- Import required libraries:

```python
from agents import Agent, Runner, ModelSettings, function_tool
from agents import CodeInterpreterTool
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import List, Dict
import json
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
```

#### 1.2 Define Your Data Structure

Create a `ShipmentJourney` dataclass to represent logistics data:

```python
@dataclass
class ShipmentJourney:
    shipment_id: str
    origin: str
    destination: str
    dispatch_time: str
    estimated_delivery: str
    actual_delivery: str
    warehouse_processing_time: int  # minutes
    transit_time: int  # hours
    delivery_delays: dict  # {"weather": 2, "traffic": 1, "customs": 3}
    delivery_status: str  # "delivered", "in_transit", "delayed"
    customer_satisfaction: int  # 1-5 scale
```

### **Phase 2: Choose Your Pattern (Day 1-2)**

Based on the logistics use case, I recommend the **Deterministic Workflow** pattern because:

- Logistics analysis follows a clear sequence: data collection ‚Üí bottleneck analysis ‚Üí route optimization ‚Üí delivery prediction
- Each step builds on the previous one logically
- Results need to be reliable and traceable for business decisions

### **Phase 3: Build Baseline Agents (Day 2-3)**

#### 3.1 Create Analysis Function Tools

```python
@function_tool
def analyze_delivery_delays(wrapper: RunContextWrapper[ShipmentJourney]) -> str:
    journey = wrapper.context
    total_delays = sum(journey.delivery_delays.values())
    if total_delays > 4:  # hours
        major_causes = [cause for cause, hours in journey.delivery_delays.items() if hours > 1]
        return f"Significant delays detected: {', '.join(major_causes)} (Total: {total_delays}h)"
    return "No major delivery delays detected."

@function_tool
def analyze_warehouse_efficiency(wrapper: RunContextWrapper[ShipmentJourney]) -> str:
    journey = wrapper.context
    if journey.warehouse_processing_time > 120:  # 2 hours
        return f"Warehouse bottleneck: {journey.warehouse_processing_time} minutes processing time"
    return "Warehouse processing within acceptable limits."

@function_tool
def check_route_efficiency(wrapper: RunContextWrapper[ShipmentJourney]) -> str:
    journey = wrapper.context
    # Simple efficiency check based on transit time vs distance (simplified)
    if journey.transit_time > 48:  # hours
        return "Route optimization needed - excessive transit time"
    return "Route efficiency acceptable."
```

#### 3.2 Define Specialized Agents

```python
# Agent 1: Delay Analysis
delay_agent = Agent[ShipmentJourney](
    name="DelayAnalysisAgent",
    instructions="Analyze delivery delays and identify major bottlenecks using shipment data.",
    model="gpt-4o",
    tools=[analyze_delivery_delays],
    output_type=str
)

# Agent 2: Warehouse Efficiency
warehouse_agent = Agent[ShipmentJourney](
    name="WarehouseAgent", 
    instructions="Evaluate warehouse processing efficiency and identify bottlenecks.",
    model="gpt-4o",
    tools=[analyze_warehouse_efficiency],
    output_type=str
)

# Agent 3: Route Optimization
route_agent = Agent[ShipmentJourney](
    name="RouteAgent",
    instructions="Assess route efficiency and suggest improvements.",
    model="gpt-4o", 
    tools=[check_route_efficiency],
    output_type=str
)

# Agent 4: Final Recommendations
recommendation_agent = Agent(
    name="LogisticsRecommendationAgent",
    instructions="Generate actionable recommendations based on delay, warehouse, and route analysis to improve logistics efficiency.",
    model="gpt-4o",
    output_type=str
)
```

### **Phase 4: Create Deterministic Pipeline (Day 3-4)**

```python
async def run_logistics_pipeline(shipment: ShipmentJourney):
    print("üöö Step 1: Analyzing delivery delays...")
    delay_result = await Runner.run(delay_agent, 
                                   input="Analyze delivery delays for optimization", 
                                   context=shipment)
    print(f"\t{delay_result.final_output}")
    
    print("üè≠ Step 2: Evaluating warehouse efficiency...")
    warehouse_result = await Runner.run(warehouse_agent,
                                       input="Evaluate warehouse processing efficiency", 
                                       context=shipment)
    print(f"\t{warehouse_result.final_output}")
    
    print("üó∫Ô∏è Step 3: Assessing route efficiency...")
    route_result = await Runner.run(route_agent,
                                   input="Assess route optimization opportunities",
                                   context=shipment)
    print(f"\t{route_result.final_output}")
    
    print("üí° Step 4: Generating recommendations...")
    combined_input = [delay_result.final_output, 
                     warehouse_result.final_output, 
                     route_result.final_output]
    final_result = await Runner.run(recommendation_agent, input=combined_input)
    print(f"\n‚úÖ Recommendations:\n{final_result.final_output}")
```

### **Phase 5: Test with Sample Data (Day 4)**

```python
# Create sample shipment data
sample_shipment = ShipmentJourney(
    shipment_id="LOG001",
    origin="London Distribution Center",
    destination="Manchester Warehouse", 
    dispatch_time="2025-01-15T08:00:00",
    estimated_delivery="2025-01-16T14:00:00",
    actual_delivery="2025-01-16T18:30:00",
    warehouse_processing_time=180,  # 3 hours - problematic
    transit_time=26,  # reasonable
    delivery_delays={"traffic": 3, "weather": 1, "customs": 0},
    delivery_status="delivered",
    customer_satisfaction=2  # poor due to delays
)

# Test the pipeline
await run_logistics_pipeline(sample_shipment)
```

### **Phase 6: Enhancement with CodeInterpreter (Day 5-6)**

Add batch analysis capability using synthetic data:

```python
# Generate synthetic logistics data
def generate_logistics_data(n=50):
    # Create 50 synthetic shipment records
    # Include various delay patterns, routes, warehouse times
    # Save as CSV for analysis

# Enhanced agent with CodeInterpreterTool
@dataclass  
class LogisticsTrendAnalysis:
    avg_delivery_time: Dict[str, float]
    common_delay_causes: Dict[str, int] 
    warehouse_efficiency_score: float
    route_optimization_opportunities: List[str]
    cost_savings_potential: float

trend_agent = Agent[LogisticsTrendAnalysis](
    name="LogisticsTrendAnalyzer",
    instructions="Analyze logistics CSV data to identify patterns, bottlenecks, and optimization opportunities. Generate charts showing delivery performance trends.",
    model="gpt-4o",
    tools=[CodeInterpreterTool()],
    output_type=LogisticsTrendAnalysis
)
```

### **Phase 7: Integration & Testing (Day 6-7)**

1. **Test individual agents** with various shipment scenarios
2. **Validate the pipeline** with edge cases (severe delays, perfect deliveries)
3. **Add error handling** for malformed data
4. **Document iterations** - what you changed and why

### **Phase 8: Analysis & Documentation (Day 7)**

#### Document in your notebook

1. **Pattern Justification**: Why deterministic workflow suits logistics analysis
2. **Tool Integration**: How each prebuilt tool (CodeInterpreter) enhances the solution
3. **Iteration Log**: Changes made and performance improvements observed
4. **Business Impact**: How the system could reduce delivery delays and costs

### **Next Steps to Start:**

1. **Create the Colab notebook** with the basic setup
2. **Define the ShipmentJourney dataclass** first
3. **Build one simple agent** (delay_agent) and test it with sample data
4. **Gradually add the other agents** one by one
5. **Connect them in the pipeline** once each works individually

### **Key Success Metrics:**

- Pipeline successfully processes shipment data
- Identifies realistic bottlenecks (warehouse delays, route inefficiencies)
- Provides actionable recommendations
- Demonstrates clear improvement through iterations
- Shows business value (cost savings, efficiency gains)
