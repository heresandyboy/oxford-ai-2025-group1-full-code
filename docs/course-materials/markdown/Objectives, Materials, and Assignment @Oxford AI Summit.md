# Objectives, Materials, and Assignment @Oxford AI Summit

## Overview & Context

- **Assignments** are embedded inside **The Oxford Artificial Intelligence Summit 2025** (27-28 June 2025) whose theme is **"Autonomous AI Agents: Learning from deployments (low-code & full-code)"**.

- Over two high-energy days **plus a follow-up week** you'll design, build and demo an autonomous-agent that tackles a real-world workflow.

## Learning Materials

## Groups & Credits

- Participants are pre-assigned to multidisciplinary **groups**.
- Group assignments: [Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pDbENfHuElmlx0EPCrSO4dOA71p6pScYv9a3n2boSn0/edit?gid=371112710#gid=371112710)

## Project Details

Over the next week your group will design and prototype a solution.

- **Project details:** You will choose **one** of the use-cases listed below and build a **full-code** or **low-code** implementation (your group has already selected which path to follow). Further technical instructions for the full-code and low-code projects will be explained during the corresponding assignment sessions.

### Build Tracks

- **Full-code** -- end-to-end solution written from scratch
- **Low-code** -- rapid build using the approved low-code platform

### Team Structure

- You will work in groups. Each group owns a single project submission.
- **Credit allocation:** Each group confirms a **Group Leader** who submits deliverables on behalf of the team and receives the formal course OpenAI credit.

### Support

- **Guidance & support:** Detailed build requirements will be provided during the corresponding assignment sessions. **Mentors** circulating in person during the event + on WhatsApp.
- **Deadline:** **6 July** (one week from the date this assignment is issued).

## Use Cases

Select **one** use-case from the list below and tailor your solution to it.

### 1. Healthcare -- Patient Journey Optimization

**Use Case:** Analyzing patient flow from admission to discharge.  
**Goal:** Identify bottlenecks (e.g., long wait times), unnecessary steps, or re-admissions to improve service delivery and reduce costs.

### 2. Manufacturing -- Production Line Efficiency

**Use Case:** Tracking production workflows from raw materials to finished goods.  
**Goal:** Detect deviations, delays, or inefficiencies in assembly lines to enhance throughput and reduce waste.

### 3. Financial Services -- Loan Application Processing

**Use Case:** Monitoring the steps from loan application to approval or rejection.  
**Goal:** Ensure compliance, reduce delays, and spot fraudulent patterns or unnecessary rework.

### 4. E-commerce -- Order-to-Cash (O2C) Process

**Use Case:** Mapping customer order fulfillment from purchase to payment.  
**Goal:** Reduce order delays, improve customer satisfaction, and optimize cash flow.

### 5. Logistics -- Shipment and Delivery Tracking

**Use Case:** Analyzing logistics operations including warehouse handling, dispatch, and delivery.  
**Goal:** Minimize delivery delays, improve routing efficiency, and manage supply chain risks.

### 6. Public Sector -- Permit and License Approvals

**Use Case:** Monitoring application processes for building permits, business licenses, etc.  
**Goal:** Streamline public services, reduce citizen wait times, and increase transparency.

### 7. IT Service Management -- Incident Resolution

**Use Case:** Mapping IT incident management (e.g., ticket creation → triage → resolution).  
**Goal:** Reduce Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR), identify recurring issues, and optimize service desk workflows.

### 8. Telecommunications -- Customer Onboarding

**Use Case:** Tracking steps for onboarding new subscribers or activating services.  
**Goal:** Ensure timely activations, reduce churn, and uncover causes of failed onboarding attempts.

### 9. Insurance -- Claims Processing

**Use Case:** Analyzing the end-to-end claims handling process.  
**Goal:** Detect fraud, accelerate payouts, and ensure regulatory compliance.

### 10. Education -- Student Enrollment and Course Progression

**Use Case:** Mapping student actions from enrollment, registration, to course completion.  
**Goal:** Identify drop-out risks, improve academic advising, and optimize program structure.
