# Agent 05 - Orchestrator

**Team Member**: Andy
**Purpose**: Coordinate all logistics agents using the "Agents as Tools" pattern

## 📁 What's in This Folder

- `agent.py` - Your main orchestrator (coordinates all other agents)
- `tools/` - Your coordination tools:
  - `agent_coordinator.py` - Plans logical workflow steps
  - `result_synthesizer.py` - Creates executive summaries
- `tests/` - Test your agent quickly with `python -m pytest -m agent05`

## 🎯 What Your Agent Does

**Your agent is the central coordinator that:**

1. **Orchestrates workflow** - Plans logical sequence of specialist agent usage
2. **Coordinates specialists** - Uses other agents as tools to solve complex problems
3. **Synthesizes results** - Combines all outputs into executive recommendations

**Data**: Your agent gets real inventory data and coordinates analysis across all domains!

**Key Feature**: Demonstrates the **"Agents as Tools"** pattern by using all other agents as tools

## 🔧 Your Tools Explained

**Coordination Tools:**

- **`agent_coordinator`**: Plans the logical workflow sequence
- **`result_synthesizer`**: Creates executive summaries from multiple agent results

**Specialist Agents (as Tools):**

- **`InventoryThresholdMonitor`**: Identifies urgent items and priorities
- **`RouteComputer`**: Calculates optimal delivery routes and schedules
- **`RestockingCalculator`**: Determines optimal quantities using demand analysis
- **`OrderConsolidator`**: Groups orders for cost savings and efficiency

## 🎯 Course Pattern Demonstration

Your agent showcases the **"Agents as Tools"** pattern:

1. **Sequential Coordination**: Use agents in logical order
2. **Result Integration**: Each agent's output feeds the next
3. **Complex Problem Solving**: Combine specialists for comprehensive solutions
4. **Executive Synthesis**: Present results at business decision level

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **First, read the main project README** to understand the setup
2. **Test your agent**: `python -m pytest -m agent05`
3. **Try the sample notebook** (copy from `notebooks/samples/`)

## 📓 Development Workflow

**Follow the iterative development process:**

👉 **[Complete Iteration Guide](../../../Getting_Started/03_Quick_Iteration_Guide.md)** 👈

**Quick workflow:**

1. Copy sample notebook: `cp notebooks/samples/agent01_sample_demo.ipynb notebooks/agent05_andy_demo.ipynb`
2. Update imports: `from ...agent_05_orchestrator.agent import Orchestrator`
3. Make changes to `agent.py` and `tools/` files in VSCode
4. Run reload cell in notebook: `importlib.reload(agent_module)`
5. Compare tool inputs/outputs across iterations
6. Document improvements and lessons learned

The guide shows you how to capture detailed tool inputs/outputs for each iteration!

## 💡 Ideas for Iterations

**Enhance orchestration logic:**

- Add conditional workflows based on urgency levels
- Implement parallel agent execution for efficiency
- Create feedback loops between agents
- Add workflow optimization based on results

**Improve coordination patterns:**

- Add error handling and retry logic for agent calls
- Implement priority-based agent sequencing
- Create workflow templates for different scenarios
- Add performance monitoring and metrics

**Enhance result synthesis:**

- Create different summary formats (technical vs executive)
- Add visualization and charts in summaries
- Include confidence scores and uncertainty measures
- Generate action plans with timelines and owners

**Advanced orchestration:**

- Implement dynamic agent selection based on context
- Add learning from previous orchestration results
- Create cost-benefit analysis for different approaches
- Build workflow optimization algorithms

## 🔗 Integration & Workflow

**Typical orchestration sequence:**

1. **Coordinate workflow** → Plan the analysis sequence
2. **Threshold Monitor** → Identify urgent items
3. **Restock Calculator** → Calculate optimal quantities
4. **Route Computer** → Plan delivery logistics
5. **Order Consolidator** → Optimize for cost savings
6. **Synthesize results** → Create executive summary

**Learning Objectives:**

- Master the "Agents as Tools" pattern
- Understand complex problem decomposition
- Practice result synthesis and reporting
- Demonstrate value of agent orchestration

Your agent is the capstone that shows how multiple specialists solve complex logistics problems! 🎯
